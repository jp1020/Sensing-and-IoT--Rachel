Hi there!

Here's the code for an Internet of Things project I finished. It involves sentiment analysis to activate a robot animatronic face named Rachel. Rachel reflects the emotions detected from what users say to it.

The two main codes are 'sending emote to arduino' which is the final code on the Raspberry Pi, that uses RESTAPIs to turn speech-to-text and sentiment analysis to return an emotion from each submitted sentence. 'Rachels-code' is the final code on the connected arduino that feeds in the emotion and controls the animatronic face with servos.

'Speech to text' is simply the raw speech to text file which was the first stage.
'Sentiment analysis' is the speech to text with added sentiment code. 

These last two files are supplimentary.

Enjoy:)
