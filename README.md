Hi there!

The two main codes are 'sending emote to arduino' which is the final code on the Raspberry Pi, and Rachel's code which is the final code on the arduino.

Speech to text is simply the raw speech to text file which was the first stage.
Sentiment analysis is the speech to text with added sentiment code. 

The last two are supplimentary.
